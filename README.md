# PDF Invoice Template
PDF template created to generate invoices based on props object. Using `jsPDF` library. ( `jsPDF` is exported also, so it can be used without importing jsPDF separately. )

Creating PDF from scratch is a nightmare (at least for me). In some project we need to use js for generating varios PDF, and mostly they are invoices PDF files. This project I've created for personal use but being here why not to share with others? 

All this code works by using an object as parameter for the function. Here some properties are optional and you can add them as empty string if you want to display nothing. Also it can be used in different languages because all labels (and all text) can be set in the props object.

<h4><b><i>Feel free for any suggestion or improvements.</i></b></h4>

This small "library" can be imported in any project via `npm` or in browser via CDN by using `jsPDFInvoiceTemplate` variable. 

Get it from NPM:

```sh
npm i jspdf-invoice-template
```

Alternatively, load latest version from a CDN:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jspdf-invoice-template@latest/dist/index.js"></script>
```

## Usage

You're ready to start creating your invoice PDF document: 

```javascript
//by importing 
import jsPDFInvoiceTemplate from "jspdf-invoice-template";

//or directly in browser
jsPDFInvoiceTemplate.default( propsObject );


//you can either import the `OutputType` const or `jsPDF` class if you want to create another PDF from scratch (without using the template) 
import jsPDFInvoiceTemplate, { OutputType, jsPDF } from "jspdf-invoice-template";

//or directly in browser
const outputTypes = jsPDFInvoiceTemplate.OutputType;
const jsPDF = jsPDFInvoiceTemplate.jsPDF();

jsPDFInvoiceTemplate.default( propsObject );
```

## Parameters object

Just edit the props object and call the function, nothing more... ðŸ˜Š

```javascript
const pdfObject = jsPDFInvoiceTemplate(props); //returns number of pages created

//or in browser
var pdfObject = jsPDFInvoiceTemplate.default(props); //returns number of pages created

var props = {
